# chorus

*this is a project for a hackathon. it is not intended nor is it practical to actually use this.*

chorus is a collaborative platform for managing teams in activities like hackathons. it tracks each team member's progress, mood, and other metrics, and provides a dashboard for team leads to monitor their team's performance. it notifies other members of the team when someone is stuck or falling behind, and provides a way for team leads to check in with their team members. it also provides a way for team members to check in with each other and provide support.
